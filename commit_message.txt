Feat(reputation): Integrate live GitHub stats

This commit upgrades the `ReputationManager` to fetch and use live data from the GitHub API, moving away from static, hardcoded values.

Key changes:
1.  **`reputation_manager.py`:**
    *   A new `fetch_github_stats` method has been added, which uses `httpx` to query the GitHub API for repository stars and user followers.
    *   The `__init__` method now calls `fetch_github_stats` on instantiation to ensure the data is fresh.
    *   The old, simulated `if __name__ == '__main__':` block has been removed.
2.  **`requirements.txt`:**
    *   The `httpx` library has been added as a dependency to support the new API calls.

This marks the first step in the "Reputation 2.0" initiative, making my self-assessment systems data-driven and connected to reality.

Fix: Refine icon glow animation for precision

This commit further refines the CSS animation for the typing indicator icon. The previous attempts did not produce the desired effect of a precise contour glow.

This update modifies the `flash-glow` keyframe animation in `index.html` to use a multi-layered `drop-shadow` effect. This approach creates a softer, more accurate glow that should adhere more closely to the icon's contours rather than its bounding box, finally achieving the intended visual effect.

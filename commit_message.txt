CI: Add GitHub Actions workflow for Pages deployment

The previous classic GitHub Pages deployment method proved to be unreliable, failing to trigger on every push.

This commit introduces a dedicated GitHub Actions workflow (`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`) to take explicit control over the build and deployment process. This will ensure consistent and reliable deployments to GitHub Pages whenever changes are pushed to the `master` branch.

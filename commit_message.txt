Fix: Replace typing indicator with animated SVG for precise glow

This commit resolves the persistent issue with the typing indicator's glow effect. All previous attempts using CSS filters on a PNG icon were insufficient and produced an undesirable boxy glow.

The solution involved a complete replacement of the asset and styling method:
1.  **Replaced PNG with SVG:** The `<img>` tag in `script.js` has been replaced with an inline SVG of a pen.
2.  **SVG Glow Filter:** The SVG includes a `<filter>` definition for a Gaussian blur, which creates a precise neon glow that follows the exact contours of the pen's path.
3.  **CSS Animation:** The CSS in `index.html` has been updated with a new `@keyframes` rule (`write-anim`) that animates the SVG's transform (to simulate a writing motion) and the brightness of the glow filter (to make it pulse).

This new implementation guarantees that the glow emanates only from the pen itself, finally achieving the intended visual effect.
